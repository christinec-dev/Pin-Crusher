# Pin-Crusher
This is an extremely basic pin guessing, command-line based game made with C++. I made it for preperation of my exams, as well as journeying into the deep waters of Unreal Engine!

## The premise of the game is as follows:
  > You are investigating the murder of your beloved Goldfish Lennie...
  > You suspect that it might be your sister, and you know that the evidence is on her phone...
  > Ugh, it's PIN PROTECTED!
  > Enter the correct pin to bust your sister!
